Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a f*ck if I cut my arm bleeding

This is my last resort
Cut my life into pieces, I've reached my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a f*ck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?
Would it be wrong? Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mudilation out of sight, and I'm contimplating suicide

Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

I never realized I was spread too thin
Till it was too late and I was empty within
Hungry, feeding on my chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?
It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
Searching to find a love upon a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils

Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

I ... can't ... go ... on ... living ... this ... way

Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a f*ck if I cut my arm bleeding

Would it be wrong? Would it be right?
If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might
Mudilation out of sight, and I'm contimplating suicide

Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

Nothing's alright, nothing is fine
I'm running and I'm crying

I ... CAN'T ... GO ... ON ... LIVING ... THIS ... WAY

Can't go on ... living this way
Nothing's alright!
